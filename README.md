# driftmark - Fund Transfer Service (gRPC)

A **gRPC-based Fund Transfer Service** implemented in Go for real-time transaction processing between accounts. This project demonstrates structured logging with **Zap**, robust error handling with gRPC status codes, and unit tests for ensuring reliability.

---

## Features

- **Real-Time Fund Transfer**: Process fund transfers between accounts with transaction details.
- **Structured Logging**: Logs using [Zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) for better observability.
- **Error Handling**: Implements gRPC error codes for precise error reporting.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes unit tests for success and failure scenarios.
- **Proto Definitions**: Based on `Protocol Buffers` for defining the service and messages.
